                    <p>Welcome to my game developer page page. Here you can follow my game developer journey or find a blog and tutorials on game development to improve your skills. It's a very friendly way to start game development if you don't have any experience. I'll be happy if you give me feedback or follow me, so you'll be updated when I post a new blog post or if you're interested in the progress of my games - socials are bellow.</p>

                <div class="main">
                    <p>It's a story driven 2D pixel art RPG game. For now it's called project BodyFrame, but we'll see about that, we can say it's a code name. Yeah, that sounds cool.</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: my "artistic name" BuckySide came from the first village in project BodyFrame, I don't remember how I came up with it, but I liked it ever since.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="main">
                    <p>I can't reveal much about the story, as it's the focus of the game, but I'm happy to share the mechanics that will be involved in the game, all of the graphics and of course the features.</p>

                <div class="main">
                    <p>You can take a look at what project BodyFrame is on the "BodyFrame" page. It's a general overview of the game, what it is and what it will be. You can find more updates on the game in the "Blogs" page under the BodyFrame blog. Or you can follow me on Twitter as I post smaller updates more often there, I only post on the website when there are enough changes.</p>

                    <p>If you're looking <b>to get into game development</b> or you're searching for game <b>development tutorials</b>, you can find those in the "Blogs" page under Game development tutorials. There is a fun pixel art aspect to every post, so learning has never been more fun.</p>

                    <p>If you're interested in playing some of my games head on to the "Games" page, where you can find some of my games. They're all in a playable state, some have more issues than others, but they're all fun. I suggest trying the <b>Spaceship Alpha</b> game. It's the most polished and very fun. I'll be happy to hear you high score!</p>
