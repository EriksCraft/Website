            		<p>Currently named Project BodyFrame is a game full of exploration, interesting mechanics and interactions, all avaliable in a beautiful pixel art world. Atleast that's how I see it, hopefully you do too. Another big part of the game is the story, which is engaging with a lot of plot twists, where your actions and decisios influence the way it plays. Well that's the plan anyway, for now I've finished version 0.11 as I've internaly named it.</p>

                <div class="main">
                    <p>Good news! There is already a lot of mechanics done in the game. Those range from different attacks and weapons, interactions with AI, story telling, inventory and more. This is my first big project and as you can see it's now one of three projects currently in development. The scope of the project is the biggest of the bunch, so the game still has a long way to go.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="main">
            		<p>One of my first videos on my YouTube channel was me having to start over with the entire game. Yes I made a classic rookie mistake of starting to learn game development on a project with an enormous scope. The world I'm currently working on is completly different to the one I've worked on at the start. The simple reason for it is that I want a playable demo as soon as possible and it has to start at the begining of the game.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of as soon as possible, this is my first big game project and I have to admit I haven't worked on it in quite a while. A lot of things happened in my life such as building a house, starting a family with my first daughter. All of that made me more focused on smaller scoped projects that I can have a chance to finish in the limited amount of time I have. But this game definetly has a special place in my heart because it's the game idea that has brewed in my head for over 5 years now. I'm sure I'll get back to it at some point.</p>

                            <p>He's my first NPC and has replaced the placeholder guy I had before. He's more advanced not just by the way he looks and moves, but he also has an animation for when he's working on his field. Does anyone have a name suggestion?</p>

                            <h2>Enemy</h2>
                            <p>his is the first enemy I've created. To be honest I was very motivated as I got extremly depressed of watching the same boring placeholder kicking my ass. I mean he didn't even have an attack animation, yet I still died. So I've created this amazing bad-ass with a big mace, to feel better about myself when I die to an enemy in my own game.</p>

                    <p>My updates are very hot and cold, sometimes I pump them out like crazy but then nothing for a couple of months. Development is a marathon and I try to focus on it and I ussualy run out of time to provide updates. However I try to post updates to either to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@buckyside" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> or you can take a look at the <a href="./blogs/blogs.html">Blogs</a> section of my website and find updates about the game there. Every now and then you can also get small sneak peaks on my <a href="https://twitter.com/SideBucky" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p>
